Description: Perl module for manipulation of ZIP archives
 The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create, manipulate,
 read, and write Zip archive files.
 .
 Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.
 Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings.
 .
 Members can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and
 enumerated.  They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments,
 or other attributes queried or modified.  Their data can be
 compressed or uncompressed as needed.  Members can be created from
 members in existing Zip files, or from existing directories, files,
 or strings.
